  abstract = {Societies under similar geographic and economic conditions and subject to similar external influences nonetheless develop very different types of states. At one extreme are weak states with little capacity and ability to regulate economic or social relations. At the other are despotic states which dominate civil society. Yet there are others which are locked into an ongoing competition with civil society and it is these, not the despotic ones, that develop the greatest capacity.  We develop a dynamic contest model of the potential competition between state (controlled by a ruler or a group of elites) and civil society (representing non-elite citizens), where both players can invest to increase their power. The model leads to different types of steady states depending on initial conditions. One type of steady state, corresponding to a weak state, emerges when civil society is strong relative to the state (e.g., having developed social norms limiting political hierarchy). Another type of steady state, corresponding to a despotic state, originates from initial conditions where the state is powerful and civil society is weak. A third type of steady state, which we refer to as an inclusive state, emerges when state and civil society are more evenly matched. In this case, each party has greater incentives to invest to keep up with the other, and this leads to the most powerful and capable type of state, while simultaneously incentivizing civil society to be equally powerful as well. Our framework highlights that comparative statics with respect to structural factors such as geography, economic conditions or external threats, are conditional — in the sense that depending on initial conditions they can shift a society into or out of the basin of attraction of the inclusive state.},

	a global schema of the integrated system is usually done manually.
	This is due to the presence of semantic and schematic heterogeneities
	among schemas of sources. In most cases, sources do not contain enough
	knowledge to help in solving these heterogeneities and then generating
	the global schema. In this paper, we present an ontology-driven integration
	approach called a priori approach. Its originality is that each data
	source participating in the integration process contains an ontology
	that defines the meaning of its own data. This approach ensures the
	automation of the integration process when all sources reference
	a shared ontology, and possibly extend it by adding their own concept
	specializations. We present two integration algorithms where (1)
	the shared ontology may be extended during the integration process,
	and (2) the instances of local sources are projected onto the shared
	ontology. Finally, we show that this theory allows to integrate automatically
	electronic catalogues into corporate engineering databases using
	the PLIB ontology model.},

	to reverse practices that seriously damage social and ecological
	systems. The depth and extent of these changes are indicated by the
	call for a conscious cultural evolution. This paper considers a possible
	contribution from accounting to comply with such an evolution.
	
	A theoretical basis for accounting’s contribution to a conscious cultural
	evolution is outlined by means of a truth classification scheme developed
	in this paper as well as the works of Foucault, Giddens, evolutionary
	biologists and life-world theorists. This theoretical basis is then
	used to interpret the results of an EU funded research project that
	was to identify the criteria and specifications for a sustainable
	development management and accounting tool. The strengths and weaknesses
	of traditional, social and environmental accounting are evaluated
	against the needs of sustainable development as identified during
	the course of this project as well as a proposed balanced accounting.
	The theoretical basis identified in this paper is further employed
	to re-evaluate the concept of accounting equity in the context of
	equitable communities and face-to-face relationships. Finally, the
	potential resistance to changes of this kind that may exist within
	contemporary mainstream accounting is considered. The end of sustainable
	development is considered within the conclusion.},

	that in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of intelligence
	and knowledge acquisition, we must broaden our concept of logic.
	Classical logic, beginning with the work of Aristotle, has developed
	into a powerful and rigorous mathematical theory with many applications
	in mathematics and computer science, but it has proved woefully inadequate
	in the search for artificial intelligence. The new kind of logic,
	also mathematically based, outlined by Professor Devlin is the culmination
	of collaborative research among some of the world's leading logicians,
	philosophers, linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists.
	It introduces the concepts of infon, a quantum of information, and
	situations, a dynamical generalization of sets, and is capable of
	handlng the issues involved in human communication, thought, speech,
	and machine information processing.},

	elements of two schemas. It is needed in many database applications,
	such as integration of web data sources, data warehouse loading and
	XML message mapping. To reduce the amount of user effort as much
	as possible, automatic approaches combining several match techniques
	are required. While such match approaches have found considerable
	interest recently, the problem of how to best combine different match
	algorithms still requires further work. We have thus developed the
	COMA schema matching system as a platform to combine multiple matchers
	in a flexible way. We provide a large spectrum of individual matchers,
	in particular a novel approach aiming at reusing results from previous
	match operations, and several mechanisms to combine the results of
	matcher executions. We use COMA as a framework to comprehensively
	evaluate the effectiveness of different matchers and their combinations
	for real-world schemas. The results obtained so far show the superiority
	of combined match approaches and indicate the high value of reuse-oriented
	strategies.},

  abstract = { This paper proposes a novel approach to storing ontologies in relational
	databases. The approach consists of a database schema, which was
	created to be capable of storing ontology information defined in
	OWL2 (Web Ontology Language 2) functional syntax. The papr explains
	how the schema has been designed and what advantages it offers to
	any user. The described schema is part of a larger system. This paper
	also discusses how the schema cooperates with the external system,
	which, however, is outside the scope of this paper, to successfully
	create, store and retrieve ontology knowledge from the functionality
	offered by the relational database. Further, this paper describes
	the implementation of the proposed method in prototype software.
	The described schema shall be the first step of the creation of an
	ontology-based database access system. },

	"Just looking at Jessie Kennedy’s presentation at the visualization
	workshop – there has been a lot of work in the biological taxonomy
	literature on visualizing taxonomy, creating the same kinds of ‘hairball’
	we get with large ontologies. Worth looking at alternatives. I attach
	a paper referred to by Jessie on some work she did with taxonomists,
	and have copied Paul Shaw (from ICS), who might be able to help…
	
	Could be good for publishing some of our ontology work…"
	
	They present two prototypes for combining similar hierarchies:
	
	A tension based graph which is tensioned by what it is not clear,
	but coloured by the hierarchy. Presumably tension is some function
	of nearness and neighbourhood. The second is a set based approach
	which I don't quite understand again, but seems to entail breaking
	down the hierarchy into "small multiples" and then comparing the
	contents of these small multiples.
	
	Their approach seems quite interesting and may be worth collaboration.
	I like their technique and use of well used procedures to establish
	utility. However, I am, on the the other hand not blown away with
	any kind of originallity.},

	This approach assumes such patterns are decoupled if I have understood

  abstract = {The design of computational models is path-dependent: the choices
	made in each step during model development constrain the choices
	that are available in the subsequent steps. The actual path of model
	development can be extremely different, even for the same system,
	because the path depends on the question addressed, the availability
	of data, and the consideration of specific expert knowledge, in addition
	to the experience, background, and modelling preferences of the modellers.
	Thus, insights from different models are practically impossible to
	integrate, which hinders the development of general theory. We therefore
	suggest augmenting the current culture of communicating models as
	working just fine with a culture of presenting analyses in which
	we try to break models, i.e., model mechanisms explaining certain
	observations break down. We refer to the systematic attempts to break
	a model as “robustness analysis” (RA). RA is the systematic deconstruction
	of a model by forcefully changing the model's parameters, structure,
	and representation of processes. We discuss the nature and elements
	of RA and provide brief examples. RA cannot be completely formalized
	into specific techniques and instead corresponds to detective work
	that is driven by general questions and specific hypotheses, with
	strong attention focused on unusual behaviours. Both individual modellers
	and ecological modelling in general will benefit from RA because
	RA helps with understanding models and identifying “robust theories”,
	which are general principles that are independent of the idiosyncrasies
	of specific models. Integrating the results of RAs from different
	models to address certain systems or questions will then provide
	a comprehensive overview of when certain mechanisms control system
	behaviour and when and why this control ceases. This approach can
	provide insights into the mechanisms that lead to regime shifts in
	actual ecological systems.},

	by admitting universals, concepts, and symbol structures and their
	interrelations. GFO adopts categories pertaining to levels of reality,
	and it is designed to support interoperability by principles of ontological
	mapping and reduction. GFO contains several novel ontological modules,
	in particular, a module for functions and a module for roles. GFO
	is designed for applications, firstly in medical, biological, and

	This latter sense is close to its Latin roots, where emergere is
	the opposite of mergere : to be submerged. In what follows, we relate
	the “act of rising out” to th e arising of some phenomenon from a
	process , and note the fact that to become visible pr esupposes some

	structure of the target world as generally as possible. However,

	it is highly desirable to have not only knowledge structuring from
	the general perspective but also from the domain-specific and multi-perspective
	so that concepts are structured for appropriate understanding from
	the multiple experts. On the basis of this observation, the authors
	propose a novel approach, called divergent exploration of an ontology,
	to bridge the gap between ontologies and domain experts. Based on
	the approach, we developed an ontology exploration tool and evaluated
	the system through an experimental use by experts in an environmental
	domain. As a result, we confirmed that the tool supports experts
	to obtain meaningful knowledge for them through the divergent exploration
	and it contributes to integrated understanding of the ontology and

	to be solved, and it is also not clear how to solve the problems
	that are identified. There has been no consensus on the underlying
	question of “What is structuring knowledge in SS?” This paper focuses
	on knowledge structuring accompanied by supporting of thinking. It
	addresses the key challenges associated with knowledge structuring
	in SS, identifies the requirements for the structuring of knowledge,
	proposes a reference model, and develops an ontology-based mapping
	tool as a solution to one layer of the reference model. First, we
	identify the important requirements for SS knowledge structuring.
	Second, we develop a reference model composed of five layers based
	on three of the requirements. Third, we develop an ontology-based
	mapping tool at Layer 2 of the reference model for meeting the two
	major challenges for SS, namely, identifying what problems should
	be addressed in SS itself and proposing solutions for those problems.
	The tool is designed to store and retrieve information regarding
	SS, to provide access to a prototype ontology for SS, and to create
	multiple maps of conceptual chains depending on a user’s interests
	and perspectives. Finally, we assess whether the developed tool successfully
	realizes the targeted part of the reference model for SS by examining
	the tool’s conformity to the reference model, as well as its usability,
	effectiveness, and constraints. Although several issues were identified
	in the prototype ontology and the mapping tool, the study concluded
	that the mapping tool is useful enough to facilitate the function
	of Layer 2. In particular, the mapping tool can support thinking
	about SS from the viewpoint of: (a) finding new potentials and risks
	of technological countermeasures studied in SS; (b) helping users
	to get a more comprehensive picture of problems and their potential
	solutions; and (c) providing an effective opportunity to come up
	with new ideas that might not be thought of without such a tool.},

	in the methodology, the philosophy and the history of mathematics.
	Much of the book takes the form of a discussion between a teacher
	and his students. They propose various solutions to some mathematical
	problems and investigate the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions.
	Their discussion (which mirrors certain real developments in the
	history of mathematics) raises some philosophical problems and some
	problems about the nature of mathematical discovery or creativity.
	Imre Lakatos is concerned throughout to combat the classical picture
	of mathematical development as a steady accumulation of established
	truths. He shows that mathematics grows instead through a richer,
	more dramatic process of the successive improvement of creative hypotheses
	by attempts to 'prove' them and by criticism of these attempts: the
	logic of proofs and refutations.},

  abstract = {There is emerging agreement that sustainability challenges require new ways of knowledge production and decision-making. One key aspect of sustainability science, therefore, is the involvement of actors from outside academia into the research process in order to integrate the best available knowledge, reconcile values and preferences, as well as create ownership for problems and solution options. Transdisciplinary, community-based, interactive, or participatory research approaches are often suggested as appropriate means to meet both the requirements posed by real-world problems as well as the goals of sustainability science as a transformational scientific field. Dispersed literature on these approaches and a variety of empirical projects applying them make it difficult for interested researchers and practitioners to review and become familiar with key components and design principles of how to do transdisciplinary sustainability research. Starting from a conceptual model of an ideal–typical transdisciplinary research process, this article synthesizes and structures such a set of principles from various strands of the literature and empirical experiences. We then elaborate on them, looking at challenges and some coping strategies as experienced in transdisciplinary sustainability projects in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia. The article concludes with future research needed in order to further enhance the practice of transdisciplinary sustainability research.},

	on the spirit. Fifth-century Greeks considered it one of three psychic
	drives, the other two being appetite and reason. The spirit reflects
	the universal human need for self-esteem, which is achieved by emulating
	the skills, character and accomplishments of people considered praiseworthy
	by our society. According to Socrates, the spirit loves honour and
	victory. It responds with anger to any impediment to self-assertion
	in private or civic life. It desires to avenge all slights of honour
	or standing to ourselves and our friends. It demands immediate action,
	which can result in ill-considered behaviour, but can be advantageous
	in circumstances where rapid responses are necessary. Even a cursory
	examination of international relations in this modern period indicates
	the continuing importance of the spirit, and the need to conceptualize
	it in a manner that helps us to understand this important but hitherto
	ignored dimension of politics at every level of social aggregation.},

	it is NOT correlated to something else. He doesn't question Eisenhower's
	motives. There is a recent argument that suggests that Eisenhower
	didn't use nuclear weapons for economic and strategic reasons. The
	economic reasons being that they didn't have enough bombs to spend
	if they wanted to actualize and effective defense using those weapons
	(not deterrence, because the theory of deterrence was still being

	conceptual framework as well. The aim is to reflect upon the role
	that a well defined ontology, based on the crossing of the philosophical
	and the computer science insights, can play to solve such questions
	and help the model building. We analyze different conceptions of
	ontology, introduce the 'ontological test' and show its usefulness
	to compare models. Then we focus on the model building and show the
	place of a systematic ABM ontology. The latter process is situated

	logic. The virtues of SDML include the ease of building complex models
	and the facility for representing agents flexibly as models of cognition
	as well as modularity and code reusability. Two representations of
	cognitive agents within organizational structures are reported and
	a Soar-to-SDML compiler is described. One of the agent representations
	is a declarative implementation of a Soar agent taken from the Radar-Soar
	model of Ye and Carley (1995). The Ye-Carley results are replicated
	but the declarative SDML implementation is shown to be much less
	computationally expensive than the more procedural Soar implementation.
	As a result, it appears that SDML supports more elaborate representations
	of agent cognition together with more detailed articulation of organizational
	structure than we have seen in computational organization theory.
	Moreover, by representing Soar-cognitive agents declaratively within
	SDML, that implementation of the Ye-Carley specification is necessarily
	consistent and sound with respect to the formal logic to which SDML

  pages = {141--172},
  abstract = {This chapter will briefly describe some common methods by which people
	make quantitative estimates of how well they expect empirical models
	to make predictions. However, the chapter’s main argument is that
	fit-to-data, the traditional yardstick for establishing confidence
	in models, is not quite the solid ground on which to build such belief
	some people think it is, especially for the kind of system agent-based
	modelling is usually applied to. Further, the chapter will show that
	the amount of data required to establish confidence in an arbitrary
	model by fit-to-data is often infeasible, unless there is some appropriate
	‘big data’ available. This arbitrariness can be reduced by constraining
	the choice of model. In agent-based models, these constraints are
	introduced by their descriptiveness rather than by removing variables
	from consideration or making assumptions for the sake of simplicity.
	By comparing with neural networks, we show that agent-based models
	have a richer ontological structure. For agent-based models, in particular,
	this richness means that the ontological structure has a greater
	significance and yet is all too commonly taken for granted or assumed
	to be ‘common sense’. The chapter therefore also discusses some approaches
	to validating ontologies.},

	the issue of model transparency. Human-natural systems models involve
	large numbers of submodels, making them difficult to understand for
	those not involved in their construction. We show that using ontologies
	to represent the structure and state of a simulation model improves
	transparency in two ways: First, the information about the structure
	and state is decoupled from the simulation software and can be independently
	processed. Second, the logics on which ontologies are based reflect
	more commonsense understandings of the relationships among concepts
	than those of computer programming languages.},

	the emergence of frozen food, and the fate of hula hooping, bring

  abstract = {We present an introduction to a novel model of an individual and group
	opinion dynamics, taking into account different ways in which different
	sources of information are filtered due to cognitive biases. The
	agent based model presented here falls into the ‘complex agent’ category,
	in which the agents are described in considerably greater detail
	than in the simplest ‘spinson’ model. To describe the information
	processing of the agents we use Bayesian updating of the individual
	belief distribution. Open nature of the proposed model allows to
	study the effects of various types of static and time-dependent biases
	and information processing filters. In particular, the paper compares
	the effects of two important psychological mechanisms: the confirmation
	bias and the politically motivated reasoning. The comparison has
	been prompted by recent experimental psychology work of Dan Kahan.
	Depending on the effectiveness of the information filtering (agent
	bias), the agents confronted with an objective information source
	may either reach a consensus based on the truth, or remain divided
	despite the evidence. In general, the model might provide an understanding
	into the increasingly polarized modern societies, especially as it
	allows mixing of different types of filters: psychological, social,
	and algorithmic.},

	vantages over simulations being run on a set of local machines. Firstly,

	mediately available to the researcher. This situation greatly decreases
	experimentation time and enables carrying out more extensive model
	parameter space exploration. Secondly, utilizing the cloud for compu-
	tations is more cost-efficient compared to local on-site computational
	infrastructure. However, using cloud introduces additional architectural
	complexity and requires specific approach to organizing and managing
	of the simulation process. In this paper we discuss a methodology
	developed by us to manage large scale computations in the ROUTE-TO-PA
	SIM project (an agent-based simulator for generalization of the dynamics
	of preferences observed on the social platform). In this work we

	terminology to classify up- date strategies and then identify different
	strategies us- ing this terminology. This will allow implementers
	and researchers in this field to use a general terminology, removing
	ambiguities when discussing ABS and their models. We will give results
	of simulating a discrete and a continuous game using our update-strategies
	and show that in the case of the discrete game only one spe- cific
	strategy seems to be able to produce its emergent patterns whereas
	the pattern of the continuous game seems to be robust under varying

	local public power, NPO seems to be one of the privileged form chosen
	by people. It has the advantage to offer a proper juridical form
	to the organisation, facilitating actions in the public area. In
	our paper we consider NPO in their french conception, called ”associations”
	and ruled by the 1901 law. They are democratic structures, where
	a board is elected, general assembly has to be scheduled every year
	with the obligation to invite all the members of the NPO to participate.
	During this assembly the board is elected, the new budget is voted
	and the realised one has to be explained. Most of the time at this
	stage NPO are locally created and gather few people, limiting their
	visibility and means available for large range of actions. To compensate
	these weaknesses NPO which fulfil same or similar goals can gather
	in networks. The network is itself a NPO with a board, a budget and
	a general assembly, it is equivalent to a NPO of NPO. Most of the
	time, to achieve a greater visibility the network has to harmonize
	the practices among its members by imposing norms (”the good practices”).
	Unfortunately this harmonization leads to numerous conflicts which
	can end up with split in network and/or large leaving among its members.
	Indeed even if all members share common objectives for the network,
	they all come with their own point of view on the practices to implement.
	Conflicts arise from the confrontation of these different points
	of view and the strong willingness of members to apply norms close
	enough to their own practices.},

	the possibility for group to communicate around their practices to
	their members. We have tested for three levels (to whom it is addressed)
	and four types (how it influences agents) of communication. We have
	shown that communication on norms despite it is not a panacea has
	a positive impact on both stability and representativeness at the
	condition of being well designed: broad and non aggressive. Interestingly
	its effects increases with the complexity of discussions in groups.
	Communication around norms is then a valuable tool to implement in
	groups wanting to improve their democratic practices without having

  abstract = {Internet is a common information space populated with many
entities (e.g., Internet of Things) with different information system types.
Each of them has its own context of how to build and process documents (e.g.,
form documents). This leads to heterogeneous documents in terms of syntax and
semantics, which are difficult to make information fusion from one context to
another. To resolve this problem, this paper uses semantic interoperability
technique which consists of two automatic stages including consistent data
understanding and reasonable data usage. To implement semantic
interoperability, this paper proposes a novel automatic tabular document
exchange (DocEx) framework comprised of a new tabular document model (TabDoc)
and a semantic inference scheme to fit the two stages above respectively. In
this TabDoc model, a new Tabular Document Language (DocLang) as a communication
medium between users and devices is provided, which is not only an information
representation language but also a rule language for semantic inference as
well. Abstract sub-tree-based semantic relations constructing the logical
structure of a tabular document are separated from their presentational
structures, clarifying the relationship between semantic groups (e.g., a cell
or a block) with the help of a common dictionary CONEX. Besides, this paper
proposes a semantic inference algorithm (SIA) executing the inference procedure
on received tabular documents created by a Table Designer system which
integrates with SIA. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to the
processing of flight ticket booking in a realistic e-business scenario. The
results show that the proposed method in this paper improves the performance of
information fusion among different information systems on the Internet.
Information fusion is realized by consistent interpretation and usage of
documents.The proposed DocLang syntax only defines an element and will not
restrict user input.Automatic document understanding and processing is
implemented by a rule language.TabDoc model contains syntactic and semantic
representation for document reusability.Tabdoc rule syntax is used for semantic
extraction in a declarative manner.},

making analyses is based on integrating Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

through interoperability, where these tools can exchange relevant information
to tackle a particular environmental problem. However, the problem of semantic
heterogeneity caused by different meanings of data, terminologies, and models
used in GIS and MCDA has been recognized as an obstacle in the interoperability
of these tools. Conventionally, exchange of data between GIS and MCDA systems
for environmental applications relies on prior knowledge to mediate meanings
between the two components. This paper proposes an ontology-enabled framework
for semantic interoperability of GIS and MCDA web services. In particular, this
study has made significant contribution to environmental decision making by
providing an interoperable framework to exchange environmental data with
intended and unambiguous meanings between GIS and MCDA services.},

be considered at different levels, starting from hardware interoperability at

  abstract = {Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are commonly used as benchmark optimisation problems and they also have many applications in industry. Using agent-based approaches to solve VRPs allows the analysis of dynamic VRP instances that incorporate congestion effects. By using a domain-speciﬁc language as part of a model-driven approach, routing problems can be modelled in an abstract form that does not contain implementation and other technical details. With such a tool domain experts can concentrate on the actual modelling task without being distracted by low-level intricacies. We present the DSL Athos in which computational and platform independent routing problems can be deﬁned. The DSL offers an efﬁcient way to model problems with seamless integration of established optimisation methods. Generators create executable code for several agent based platforms. Proof of concept is given by applying the tools to the Oliver 30 TSP and aninstance of a dynamic TSP.},
  review = {A proposal for a DSL. I think I have most of it, but a syntax guide might have been helpful. I think I get the idea. I am not sure how this is going to be useful. It would be nice to look at the code, and check the syntax, but no links are provided. Other than the techniques used to generate the plugin. In fact probably a bit of a waste of time reading this paper.},

The meaning of the term is strongly dependent on the context in which it is applied and on whether its use is based on a social, economic, or ecological perspective, Sustainability may be defined broadly or narrowly, but a useful definition must specify explicitly the context as well as the temporal and spatial scales being considered. Although societies differ in their conceptualizations of sustainability, indefinite human survival on a global scale requires certain basic support systems, which can be maintained only with a healthy environment and a stable human population. A clearer understanding of global sustainability and the development of appropriate indicators of the status of basic support systems would provide a useful framework for policy making.},

A transdisciplinary approach is a key component of sustainability science. However, there are considerable barriers to implementing transdisciplinary projects. We undertake a mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis of peer-reviewed sustainability science studies where the transdisciplinary approach has been applied. We assess the growth and scientific impact of transdisciplinary sustainability research, the methods used and how three key characteristics of transdisciplinarity research—process phases, knowledge types and the intensity of involvement of practitioners—are implemented. While transdisciplinary research is growing there is no common glossary, no focused communication platform and no commonly shared research framework. Transdisciplinary research utilizes a broad, but not clearly defined, set of methods for knowledge production. While the intensity of practitioner involvement varied within the case studies analyzed, very few realized empowerment. Based on our review of transdisciplinary case study papers we conclude that transdisciplinary research must be clearly framed, including the use of a common terminology and the development of a broad suite of appropriate methods. Despite the challenges highlighted here, science needs to move beyond classical disciplinary approaches and should consider interdisciplinary work that engages with practitioners to achieve sustainable transitions.},

This review of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research evaluation categorizes lessons from the emergent international literature on the topic reviewed in 2007. It defines parallels between research performance and evaluation, presents seven generic principles for evaluation, and reflects in the conclusion on changing connotations of the underlying concepts of discipline, peer, and measurement. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research performance and evaluation are both generative processes of harvesting, capitalizing, and leveraging multiple expertise. Individual standards must be calibrated, and tensions among different disciplinary, professional, and interdisciplinary approaches carefully managed in balancing acts that require negotiation and compromise. Readiness levels are strengthened by antecedent conditions that are flexible enough to allow multiple pathways of integration and collaboration. In both cases, as well, new epistemic communities must be constructed and new cultures of evidence produced. The multidisciplinary–interdisciplinary–transdisciplinary research environment spans a wide range of contexts. Yet seven generic principles provide a coherent framework for thinking about evaluation: (1) variability of goals; (2) variability of criteria and indicators; (3) leveraging of integration; (4) interaction of social and cognitive factors in collaboration; (5) management, leadership, and coaching; (6) iteration in a comprehensive and transparent system; and (7) effectiveness and impact.},

  abstract = {Objective. To summarize findings from a systematic exploration of existing literature and views regarding interdisciplinarity, to discuss themes and components of such work, and to propose a theoretically based definition of interdisciplinary research.

Data Sources/Study Setting. Two major data sources were used: interviews with researchers from various disciplines, and a systematic review of the education, business, and health care literature from January 1980 through January 2005.

Study Design. Systematic review of literature, one‐on‐one interviews, field test (survey).

Data Collection/Extraction Methods. We reviewed 14 definitions of interdisciplinarity, the characteristics of 42 interdisciplinary research publications from multiple fields of study, and 14 researcher interviews to arrive at a preliminary definition of interdisciplinary research. That definition was then field tested by 12 individuals with interdisciplinary research experience, and their responses incorporated into the definition of interdisciplinary research proposed in this paper.

Principal Findings. Three key definitional characteristics were identified: the qualitative mode of research (and its theoretical underpinnings), existence of a continuum of synthesis among disciplines, and the desired outcome of the interdisciplinary research.

Conclusion. Existing literature from several fields did not provide a definition for interdisciplinary research of sufficient specificity to facilitate activities such as identification of the competencies, structure, and resources needed for health care and health policy research. This analysis led to the proposed definition, which is designed to aid decision makers in funding agencies/program committees and researchers to identify and take full advantage the interdisciplinary approach, and to serve as a basis for competency‐based formalized training to provide researchers with interdisciplinary skills.},

  abstract  = {Scientists, stakeholders and decision makers face trade-offs between adopting simple or complex approaches when modeling ecosystem services (ES). Complex approaches may be time- and data-intensive, making them more challenging to implement and difficult to scale, but can produce more accurate and locally specific results. In contrast, simple approaches allow for faster assessments but may sacrifice accuracy and credibility. The ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) modeling platform has endeavored to provide a spectrum of simple to complex ES models that are readily accessible to a broad range of users. In this paper, we describe a series of five “Tier 1” ES models that users can run anywhere in the world with no user input, while offering the option to easily customize models with context-specific data and parameters. This approach enables rapid ES quantification, as models are automatically adapted to the application context. We provide examples of customized ES assessments at three locations on different continents and demonstrate the use of ARIES' spatial multi-criteria analysis module, which enables spatial prioritization of ES for different beneficiary groups. The models described here use publicly available global- and continental-scale data as defaults. Advanced users can modify data input requirements, model parameters or entire model structures to capitalize on high-resolution data and context-specific model formulations. Data and methods contributed by the research community become part of a growing knowledge base, enabling faster and better ES assessment for users worldwide. By engaging with the ES modeling community to further develop and customize these models based on user needs, spatiotemporal contexts, and scale(s) of analysis, we aim to cover the full arc from simple to complex assessments, minimizing the additional cost to the user when increased complexity and accuracy are needed.},

So we split into

1) Observable semantics - data
2) Observation semantics - how the data were gathered
3) Context semantics - where 1) and 2) took place.

Above addresss "interoperable and resusable" in FAIR

Universals vs particulars, with particulars having continuants and occurrents

These are all classes.

Universals, like the colour black qualify particulars like rocks. So universals cannot be observed directly.

My notes sent to Gary:

If I have understood it correctly then they have  a strictly defined set of named classes and relations (which are translatable to OWL) and have constructed their language from that. So they appear to have done what we want to – they have a domain specific language for model integration. However they are using it to annotate existing models.

They have 3 sets of semantics, these being:

1) Observable semantics – what is being measured (i.e. a collection of measurements with some commonality)
2) Observation semantics - how the data were gathered, so units of measurement, scale, etc.
3) Context semantics - where 1) and 2) took place.

They concentrate on documents* for this paper, but the annotations can apply elsewhere such as subjects (as in subject, object, predicate), but this does not appear to be as developed (but I may have minterpreted that).

So here is the crux, and observable is a class of data, observations are instances of that class:
Two observables (O1, O2) are compatible if and only if:
•	The main observable concept in O1 (without considering traits and inherency) equals, or is a more specialized version of, the main observable in O2;
•	O1 adopts all the same traits and roles as O2 (which may have additional traits); e.g. the main observable in O1 and O2 may be a generic length, but if O1 is vertical, O2 must also be;
•	If O1 has an inherent type (of), O2 must have a compatible one;
•	If O1 has a context type (within), O2 must have a compatible one.
If observables are compatible, their observations are interoperable. They are FAIR+ interoperable if and only if:
•	Their observables are compatible;
•	Their observation semantics can be mediated (e.g. both are measurements in compatible, but possibly different units);
•	Their context can be mediated: the intersection of the extents (e.g. space, time) of the scale for both observables is non-empty and the resolution of each extent is the same as, or can be resampled to fit, the other’s.


"Distributed databases with their contents annotated according to a common worldview can allow the kind of large-scale, yet precise, semantically-driven interoperability that has so far remained a high-ranking wish in the semantic web community. SMM, a modeling approach where FAIR+ interoperability is an integral requirement, sees data and models as definitions for possible observations: while datasets can produce, possibly through mediation of observation or context semantics, the requested observations in a self-contained way, models do so through computation that may involve the observation of other concepts they depend on, to be resolved through other data or models.

This is a critique of the new version of the ISO700 standard which I don't have
and the standard texts for terminology, which I need to identify. There is a
bit of reach here. The conclusions state that if we don't get this correct then
it is going to fuck with AI systems that require formal representation systems
if they are going to work. This is quite nice, because it gives some kind of
formal grist to my mill about the problems with AI 

This seems a bit over the place to me. I like the previous claim, but the
conclusion does not seem to have anything with the main text, which I should
have noticed in the title of the sub-section: "Conclusion and Perspectives" 

The primary moan is the omission of the _essential characterstic_ which appears
to have been removed from the new standard.

They coin the term "ontoterminology" for a formallly linked set of terminology
(but only mention the phrase in the abstract and once in the conclusion - weird
 way of writing a paper.  French authors - explains it.) Ah this is a subject of one of his papers.

  abstract={Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to intro- duce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

  keywords = {SANDHYA},
  abstract={The many motivations for employing agent-based computation in the social sciences are reviewed. It is argued that there exist three distinct uses of agent modeling techniques. One such use — the simplest — is conceptually quite close to traditional simulation in operations research. This use arises when equations can be formulated that completely describe a social process, and these equations are explicitly soluble, either analytically or numerically. In the former case, the agent model is merely a tool for presenting results, while in the latter it is a novel kind of Monte Carlo analysis. A second, more commonplace usage of computational agent models arises when mathematical models can be written down but not completely solved. In this case the agent-based model can shed significant light on the solution structure, illustrate dynamical properties of the model, serve to test the dependence of results on parameters and assumptions, and be a source of counter-examples. Finally, there are important classes of problems for which writing down equations is not a useful activity. In such circumstances, resort to agent-based computational models may be the only way available to explore such processes systematically, and constitute a third distinct usage of such models.},

To this end, we define agent-based modeling and offer potential uses for it in typical evaluation activities, including: engaging stakeholders, selecting an intervention, modeling program theory, setting performance targets, and interpreting evaluation results. We provide demonstrative examples from published agent-based modeling efforts both inside and outside the field of evaluation for each of the evaluative activities discussed. We further describe potential pitfalls of this tool and offer cautions for evaluators who may chose to implement it in their practice. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of the future of agent-based modeling in evaluation practice and a call for more formal exploration of this tool as well as other approaches to simulation modeling in the field.},

  abstract = {With considerably increased coverage of weather information in the news media in recent years in many countries, there is also more demand for data that are applicable and useful for everyday life. Both the perception of the thermal component of weather as well as the appropriate clothing for thermal comfort result from the integral effects of all meteorological parameters relevant for heat exchange between the body and its environment. Regulatory physiological processes can affect the relative importance of meteorological parameters, e.g. wind velocity becomes more important when the body is sweating. In order to take into account all these factors, it is necessary to use a heat-balance model of the human body. The physiological equivalent temperature (PET) is based on the Munich Energy-balance Model for Individuals (MEMI), which models the thermal conditions of the human body in a physiologically relevant way. PET is defined as the air temperature at which, in a typical indoor setting (without wind and solar radiation), the heat budget of the human body is balanced with the same core and skin temperature as under the complex outdoor conditions to be assessed. This way PET enables a layperson to compare the integral effects of complex thermal conditions outside with his or her own experience indoors. On hot summer days, for example, with direct solar irradiation the PET value may be more than 20 K higher than the air temperature, on a windy day in winter up to 15 K lower.},

  abstract ={Learning is represented in economic models either as a process of estimating equations which are known to be correct representations of the environment or as a process of sampling from a known probability distribution. It is arguably more natural to represent leaning as the specification of equations or other relationships in conditions where information processing capacity is not sufficiently powerful as to enable agents to identify such global characteristics of the whole information set as the moments of a probability distribution. Techniques drawn from the literature on machine learning and on knowledge-based systems are coming into use as tools for modelling learning in such conditions. In this paper I describe the key differences between the older and newer approaches to the modelling of learning and decision-making in terms of two metaphors: the menu and the agenda. Two agenda-type algorithms—a genetic algorithm and a production system — are applied to a simple economic model to show that they imply quite different descriptions of learning and decision-making. Moreover, the production system finds the optimal behaviour orders of magnitude faster than the genetic algorithm because — it is suggested — it is the better descriptor of actual strategic decision-making behaviour in normally complex economic conditions.},

The framework is influenced by recent methodologies for knowledge level descriptions of intelligent systems. The methods for case retrieval, reuse, solution testing, and learning are summarized, and their actual realization is discussed in the light of a few example systems that represent different CBR approaches.

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems.

Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext.

What they mean by it might be similar "Affordances are information perceived from the environment that signifies that a particular action may be performed." (p510).

    This has given me an idea. NetLogo plugin that calls microservices.

    This approach is obvious, but then all the best ideas are "obvious".

      Interesting exericise in replication. Not a huge example, so I need to research statistical significance. Okay given the small number of replications then the popultion size cannot be statistically significant. However the result might be if there the result passed the threshold of probability presuming the null result.

          So their conclusion is data preparation varies wildly across researchers. Of the two studies they tried to replicate this had a massive effect in one of them (50\%!)

          The sample size is inconclusive though but is probably indicative.

          Okay if the population is small then the probability that this is an unreliable event is high. The statistical significance of a population seems to turn on the statistical method undertaken, the degree of certainty required, the degree with which the entire population fits the confidence level (where confidence level is the probability that the entire population is covered in the range of responses of the sample).

          They refer to this as the researcher degrees of freedom in data construction.

  author={Machado, Jenny and Villegas-Palacio, Clara and Loaiza, Juan Carlos and Casta{\~n}eda, Dario A},
  journal={Ecological indicators},
  abstract={In recent decades, the literature on ecosystem services has pointed to the need to quantify and characterise Soil Natural Capital (SNC) under different types of land use and cover. This points to the need of understanding the SNC processes which define the provision of ecosystem services, as well as their changes through anthropogenic time. Tropical regions are subjected to a high rate of land use transformation which may change the properties of the soil, and consequently the potential provision of ecosystem services. This paper presents a proposal for the quantification and characterization of SNC through an index of vulnerability to changes in land cover vegetation and their influence on the provision of ecosystem services for the prevention of soil erosion in tropical soils. The proposed vulnerability index considers aspects of the SNC such as the changes produced in the dynamic properties of different soil types under different types of land-use. The proposed analysis was implemented in a basin measuring 1.280 km2 situated in the department of Antioquia (Colombia) in humid tropical conditions, where 93% of the soil presents andic properties. Understanding the consequences of the land cover changes for the provision of ecosystem services, as well as how to obtain the spatial representation of the vulnerability current from SNC, allow the identification of areas in which the provision of ecosystem services is at risk inasmuch as the definition of land use policies.},

  abstract={Modern epidemiological analyses to understand and combat the spread of disease depend critically on access to, and use of, data. Rapidly evolving data, such as data streams changing during a disease outbreak, are particularly challenging. Data management is further complicated by data being imprecisely identified when used. Public trust in policy decisions resulting from such analyses is easily damaged and is often low, with cynicism arising where claims of ‘following the science’ are made without accompanying evidence. Tracing the provenance of such decisions back through open software to primary data would clarify this evidence, enhancing the transparency of the decision-making process. Here, we demonstrate a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data pipeline. Although developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, it allows easy annotation of any data as they are consumed by analyses, or conversely traces the provenance of scientific outputs back through the analytical or modelling source code to primary data. Such a tool provides a mechanism for the public, and fellow scientists, to better assess scientific evidence by inspecting its provenance, while allowing scientists to support policymakers in openly justifying their decisions. We believe that such tools should be promoted for use across all areas of policy-facing research.},

      I like this idea of being to query whether a dataset is already registered.

      Onto provenance tools - again these look really interesting.

      Camflow in particularly looks really interesting. You need to look this up.
      If I have read between the lines correctly. These are all the same as ours and require coding primitives inserted in existent code, in order to record a provenance event.

      Re-use large parts of this for your paper, because this is superbly researched.
      Finished the paper, but no clearer on how to implement it, but I now understand what the example is about, so will begin investigating this a bit more tomorrow.

      \begin{markup}
      So interesting. What I think of as a hierarchical database they view as a graph database. Which I suppose makes sense. Not strictly speaking true, but arguably close enough. Their distinctions on what constitutes a type of database seem somewhat constructed to me. This paper just list a series of programs and doesn't actually get into the guts of using a graph database. This might be more useful once I know a little more about graphing databases.
  
      So their their models of databases are:

+ Relational - oracle, sql, postgres, sqlite
+ [Semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_data_model) OWL? Fuck me, yes! So this is your preferred database model at the moment, which is also semi-structured and arguably graph based.
+ Graph - gremlin
+ [Object oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database) - these will expose object stubs for use by object oriented languages.

+ Semi-structed - XML, RDF and OWL
+ [Deductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_database) - ah ha you have used one of these and have actually written a compiler for one: DataLog
+ Network - the difference between this and a graph database is that the fields are fixed in a network database, so all records can be related to any other, this has to be predefined.
+ Hierarchical - I have used these in ICL, every parent could have multiple child records. IBM IMS is an example of this. So you might have a customer details block attached to several order data blocks. This makes sense. This would
+ Multidimenisonal - So a relational database is effectively relational algebra in two dimensions, whereas is done in more than two. I will have to refresh my relational algebra to get my head around this. However these databases appear to be especially prevalent in OLAP.
  
The distinction between these seems largely between graph/relational/deductive. I think some of the distinctions above are largely historical and formalistic.

The distinction between hierarchy and graph is that data structure is key to the  hierarchy. The atomicity of data is low. Thus the database is highly coupled with high cohesion. A graph database is low coupled and low cohesion. Makes sense. In a hierarchical database you may only have one to many relationships, wherease in a network database you can have many to many relationships. This makes navigation ambiguous. Oh I am beginning to get this.

Briefly revising relational algebra, then this is based on the idea of ordered sets, if I remember correctly.

  abstract={This article provides an angular-based radiometric slope correction routine for Sentinel-1 SAR imagery on the Google Earth Engine platform. Two established physical reference models are implemented. The first model is optimised for vegetation applications by assuming volume scattering on the ground. The second model is optimised for surface scattering, and therefore targeted at urban environments or analysis of soil characteristics. The framework of both models is extended to simultaneously generate masks of invalid data in active layover and shadow affected areas. A case study, using openly available and reproducible code, exemplarily demonstrates the improvement of the backscatter signal in a mountainous area of the Austrian Alps. Furthermore, suggestions for specific use cases are discussed and drawbacks of the method with respect to pixel-area based methods are highlighted. The radiometrically corrected radar backscatter products are overcoming current limitations and are compliant with recent CEOS specifications for SAR backscatter over land. This improves a wide range of potential usage scenarios of the Google Earth Engine platform in mapping various land surface parameters with Sentinel-1 on a large scale and in a rapid manner. The provision of an openly accessible Earth Engine module allows users a smooth integration of the routine into their own workflows.},

We used the coupled model to explore various mechanisms for giving incentives to farmers to manage for better biodiversity, including activity-based, outcome-based and clustered incentives, in which farmers potentially benefit from the activities of neighbours. In so doing, we demonstrate the benefit of using such models to explore ‘in principle’ questions pertaining to biodiversity policy. The results show that the effectiveness of government policies in protecting target vulnerable species can depend on a number of other factors influencing agricultural land-use decision-making, such as input costs, market variability and farmer aspiration levels. They also show that the way these factors influence species persistence can vary from species to species.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with the use of empirical data in social science agent-based models. Agent-based models are too often viewed just as highly abstract thought experiments conducted in artificial worlds, in which the purpose is to generate and not to test theoretical hypotheses in an empirical way. On the contrary, they should be viewed as models that need to be embedded into empirical data both to allow the calibration and the validation of their findings. As a consequence, the search for strategies to find and extract data from reality, and integrate agent-based models with other traditional empirical social science methods, such as qualitative, quantitative, experimental and participatory methods, becomes a fundamental step of the modelling process. The paper argues that the characteristics of the empirical target matter. According to characteristics of the target, ABMs can be differentiated into case-based models, typifications and theoretical abstractions. These differences pose different challenges for empirical data gathering, and imply the use of different validation strategies.},

A related trend is that more and more scientific communities realize the benefits of sharing their data and computational services, and are thus contributing to a distributed data and computational community infrastructure (a.k.a. ‘the Grid’). However, this infrastructure is only a means to an end and ideally scientists should not be too concerned with its existence. The goal is for scientists to focus on development and use of what we call scientific workflows. These are networks of analytical steps that may involve, e.g., database access and querying steps, data analysis and mining steps, and many other steps including computationally intensive jobs on high-performance cluster computers. In this paper we describe characteristics of and requirements for scientific workflows as identified in a number of our application projects. We then elaborate on Kepler, a particular scientific workflow system, currently under development across a number of scientific data management projects. We describe some key features of Kepler and its underlying Ptolemy II system, planned extensions, and areas of future research. Kepler is a community-driven, open source project, and we always welcome related projects and new contributors to join. },

  abstract={A new cluster resource management system called Simple Linux Utility Resource Management (SLURM) is described in this paper. SLURM, initially developed for large Linux clusters at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), is a simple cluster manager that can scale to thousands of processors. SLURM is designed to be flexible and fault-tolerant and can be ported to other clusters of different size and architecture with minimal effort. We are certain that SLURM will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the Sun Grid Engine distributed resource management software and of future plans to enhance it towards and integrate it into computational grid environments. The main scope of many of today's Grid research projects is to understand and demonstrate the actual potential of networking, computing and software infrastructure for computational Grids and to build proof-of-concept middleware. This has resulted in Internet infrastructure projects like Globus (Foster and Kesselman, 1997), Legion (Chapin et al., 1999), and Punch (Kapadia and Fortes, 1999) which enable users to combine a set of distributed resources into one integrated Grid Workbench to allow users to measure nature (e.g, with microscope, telescope or particle accelerator), process the measured data according to fundamental mathematical equations (e.g. the Navier-Stokes or Maxwell equations), and provide computer simulations and animations to study and understand these complex phenomena.},

Utility converts node labels to property "name". If node has no label utility generates warning and uses original NodeId as "name".},
